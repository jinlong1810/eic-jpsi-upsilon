simu_p.C to generate events in root tree

accept.C to add acceptance entry in tree

other scripts to analysis results

= how it works =
1. simu_p.C

compile it (an example on ifarm, with tsch)
source /apps/root/5.34.21/setroot_CUE.csh
make O=simu_p

run by
./simu_p -n[nevents as integer like 1000000] -t[e for electroproduction,g for photoproduction] -b[Ebeam in GeV] -o[output_root_file]
for example
./simu_p -n1e6 -te -b11 -ooutput.root

refer to PAC39 proposal for the crossection formula

electroproduction
scattered electon p,theta,phi and recoil proton theta, phi, decay angle theta and phi are degree of freedom
special Jacob J
special decay distribution

(***unfinished!!!!!!!****) photoproduction (by bremstrlung from a fix energy electron beam on a radiator)
Gbeam,recoil proton theta, phi,decay angle theta and phi are degree of freedom
decay angle theta and phi are two addtionl degree of freedom,but are handled differently by  weight_decay integrated to 4pi
special Jacob J
special decay distribution

The similation throw events evenly in the ranges of the all degree of freedom and only keep the events with right kinematics 

"phasespace" is the total phasespace
"weight" is for weighting (0 or 0.5 or 1) of two possible kinematic solutions of proton mom
"weight_decay" is for JPsi decay weight
"dxs*" three crossection models, t-channel "dxs", 2g model "dxs_2g", "dxs_23g", in unit nb/GeV2
"neve" the thrown number of events while only events passing kinematics are recorded which ouput until the number of events defined in command line option

output root file has a tree "T"

2. accep.C
root [0] .x accep.C+("output.root","acceptance_solid_JPsi_electron_target315_output.root")
it will take the output root file from simu_p and add acceptance entries.
acceptance can be read from acceptance root file which are just histograms from simulation code or some rough cut estimation

3. others
proj.C
root [0] .x proj.C("output_accep.root","e")
plots results, output total events on terminal

plot_crossection.C
plot photon crossection fit function, matching paper "Brodsky Physics Letters B 498 (2001) 23¨C28" Fig 3

plot_brem.C

compare.C 
compare total detected events (as FOM) from different simulation files.

plot_acceptance.C
compare acceptance from different simulation files

= history =

current code is based on Xin's code with changes
1. correct a bug to have +Q2 in definition of R which is related to JPsi decay only
2. modify to read acceptance root file from code "acceptance" with SoLID GEMC

Xin Qian's code used for PAC39 proposal in dir "forzhiwen"

Xin Qian's very early code in dir "xqian" which has only t-channel model and different way to handle decay etc

accep.root is for acceptance from Geant3 with BaBar made by Xin and used for PAC39 proposal
